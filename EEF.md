## Description of the organization affiliated
### IEEE uOttawa
A non-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest professional
 association for the advancement of technology.

A student branch of the IEEE, the IEEE uOttawa Student Branch is a
student association that organizes events and provides services to
uOttawa students to enhance their student experience
### CUSEC
The Canadian University Software Engineering Conference is a three-day
event that brings together undergraduate and post-graduate students for
learning, networking, and sharing their passion for software. CUSEC 
2013 will happen from January 17-19, 2013 in Montreal, Quebec.

## Detailed description
### What it is?
This project aims to bring as much students as possible to the 2013 
iteration of CUSEC.

My goal is to bring so many uOttawa students to CUSEC that all the
other delegations will be dwarfed in comparison.

To decrease the cost of participating to the event is essential in
gathering as many attendees as possible. It will also help students
with low revenue who would like to participate but couldn't otherwise.
### What will be done?
* __Seek official support from the Faculty to encourage student's
participation.__ We will present a motion to the Faculty Council,
requesting professor's collaboration in enabling student's attendance
to the conference.  The corpus of this motion can be found [here][1].  

> Many professors already manifested their support, including Marcel 
Turcotte, Timothy Lethbridge, Daniel Amyot, Herna L. Viktor and
Liam Peyton.

* __Promote the event.__ We will go present and sell the project to
students in their classes this Fall.  We are also actively promoting
the event on Facebook.  We also intend on producing posters to placard
the walls of the Faculty's building.
* __Take registration.__ We will manage the purchase of tickets and
the booking of hotel rooms on behalf of the delegates.
* __Transport the delegation.__ In collaboration with the Carleton IEEE
student branch, we will transport the delegation back and forth to the
conference's location.

### Timeline
* __Oct 1, 2012.__ Application for EEF.
* __Oct 16, 2012.__ Presentation of Motion to the Faculty Council.
* __Oct 2012 to early Jan 2013.__ Registration of delegates.
* __Nov 2012 to Jan 2013.__  Promotion of the conference in
coordination with uOttawa IEEE and the Vice-Dean of Undergrads - and
the Faculty, conditional to the acceptance of the Motion.
* __1900h, Jan 16 2013.__ Departure from uOttawa.
* __Jan 19 2013.__ Return to uOttawa.

### Why we meet the requirements.
* __Request must benefit Engineering students at the University of
Ottawa.__ The conference is specifically targetted at Engineering
students.  It is a great occasion for them to learn, network and get
jobs/internships with top tech companies.
* __The exact nature of this benefit has not been predefined.__ 
Yes...!
* __The allocation committee welcomes novel and innovative project
ideas.__ uOttawa has never dwarfed other delegations to CUSEC.  We
hope to flood CUSEC's floor with uOttawa delegates.
* __Ideas must fit within University policy.__ The University has been
supportive of this conference in the past, and this year again.  The
University also provided speakers to the conference in previous years
(Timothy Lethbridge, 2002).
* __The maximum amount that can be requested is $9 000.00.__ We
request $8 623.80.
* __The EEF cannot pay for food or drink.__ The cost estimate doesn't
include food or drink, and the fund received will not be used for such
expenses.

## Promotion/Marketing
* The conference is actively promoted on Facebook, where 22 students
already demonstrated their intention to attend.
* As more speakers and sponsors are confirmed for the conference, we
will start to give short presentation about CUSEC to students at the
beginning of their classes.
* We expect active support from the professors, asking for their help
by accommodating delegates and by recommending the conference to their
students.

## Funding details
### Budget.
We are planning to bring 40 students to the conference. The cost of
the event to the student will be 180$, which includes the
registration for the event (60$) and the hotel accommodations (120$).
```
Conference fees    40   *   60$ = 2400.00$
          Hotel    40   *  120$ = 4800.00$
Transportation*    1.13 * 1260$ = 1423.80$
                                  ________
          Total                   8623.80$
```
*Estimate from previous years (similar from 2010 to 2012)

We will try to get sponsorship from local companies.

Students will have to assume the initial cost of attending, and we will
refund them with the EEF funds if we are granted such funds.
